# PizzaOS
It is an operating system designed for **computation without limits.** No more stupid 4GB barriers. No more half-a-century-old unsolved mystery bugs. No more nights pulling hair out with Dependency Hell. This OS is meant for people who want to do things that aren't possible on any regular Windows or Mac computer. Say hello to PizzaOS.  

I know, I know, I get overenthusiastic. Forgive me. üôè

## Why did you name it after pizza???
1. Pizza is _desirable_, _addictive_, and you'll _love it_ no matter what. That's where the name *PizzaOS* comes from.  
2. Pizza is one of my favorite foods (like any other sane human without health issues)
