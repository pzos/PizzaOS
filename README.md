# PizzaOS
It is an operating system designed for **computation without limits.** No more stupid 4GB limits. No more half-a-century-old unsolved mystery bugs. No more nights pulling hair out with DLLs and function exports. This OS is meant for people who want to do things that aren't possible on any regular Windows or Mac computer. Say hello to PizzaOS.

# IMPORTANT
I will be gone for this week. Development will resume next week (on the 13th).

## Why did you name it after pizza???
1. Pizza is _desirable_, _addictive_, and you'll _love it_ no matter what. That's where the name *PizzaOS* comes from.  
2. Pizza is one of my favorite foods (like any other sane human)
