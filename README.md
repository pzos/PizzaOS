# PizzaOS
It is an operating system designed for **computation without limits.** No more stupid x86 addressing space. No more PE32+ which can only hold 1.65GB of code. No more nights pulling hair out with DLLs. This OS is meant for people who want to do things that aren't possible on any regular Windows or Mac computer. Say hello to PizzaOS.

## Why did you name it after pizza???
1. Pizza is my favorite food (like any other sane 12 year old)  
2. Pizza is _desirable_, _addictive_, and you'll _love it_ no matter what. That's where the name *PizzaOS* comes from.
