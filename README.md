# PizzaOS
It is an operating system designed for **computation without limits.** No more stupid 4GB barriers. No more half-a-century-old unsolved mystery bugs. No more nights pulling hair out with DLLs/DYLIBs and function exports. This OS is meant for people who want to do things that aren't possible on any regular Windows or Mac computer. Say hello to PizzaOS.  
I programmed it as pure 64-bit since the start of it all, so there shouldn't be any concern about "backwards-compatibility" unless if it moves to a new architecture (I'm thinking 512-bit if Intel survives the blood feud against Apple)...

# Help needed
I am hopelessly lost on loading the C kernel. QEMU goes into a boot loop as soon as I call `pz_kernel_start`. I have no idea what is going on even after literally 5 hours of staring at Google and Stack Overflow. Please look through the source files and help if you can. Until then, development will be halted - I can't figure this out at all. Sorry.

## Why did you name it after pizza???
1. Pizza is _desirable_, _addictive_, and you'll _love it_ no matter what. That's where the name *PizzaOS* comes from.  
2. Pizza is one of my favorite foods (like any other sane human)
